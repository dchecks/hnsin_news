# hnsin_news

Inspired by Facebook showing Australians how good things could be.

This is a simple hn home page clone with the blacklisted news sites removed.

Credit for the template goes to: https://github.com/danrobinson/taggernews (a project I've played around with in the past)

Pull requests for additional blacklisted sites and features are welcome!
